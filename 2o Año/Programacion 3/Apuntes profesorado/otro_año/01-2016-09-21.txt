				The classes are part of a class hierarchy via inheritance
		- Encapsulation (object state and behavior are wrapped together hiding information (mechanism to restrict access to stuff which is not relevant outisde)).
					state: set of attributes and their values 
					behaviour: set of operations you may ask to the object to perme
					identity: property that differentiates one object from another
	- procedural (C (a√±o pasado)).
	- logical (Prolog).
